# Execute Playwright TypeScript PRP

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution Mission

Transform a comprehensive Playwright TypeScript PRP into **production-ready test automation** through systematic implementation following the PRP blueprint.

**Critical Success Factors**:
- Follow PRP specifications exactly - no deviations without explicit justification
- Implement all validation gates as specified in the PRP
- Achieve all success criteria defined in the PRP document
- Maintain TypeScript type safety throughout test implementation
- Ensure test reliability and maintainability from day one

## Pre-Execution Validation

### PRP Quality Check

Before starting implementation, validate the PRP meets execution standards:

- [ ] PRP contains all required sections from Playwright TypeScript template
- [ ] Implementation tasks are dependency-ordered and specific
- [ ] Validation commands are Playwright/TypeScript-specific and executable
- [ ] Context references include exact file paths and URL anchors
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable and test-automation focused

### Environment Setup Validation

```bash
# Verify Playwright TypeScript environment is ready
npx playwright --version                    # Confirm Playwright installation
node --version && npm --version            # Verify Node.js environment
npx tsc --version                          # Confirm TypeScript compiler
npx playwright install                     # Ensure browsers are installed
npx playwright check                       # Validate test environment setup
```

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Context Integration

1. **Read PRP Document Thoroughly**
   - Extract all context references (URLs, file patterns, configuration requirements)
   - Note all specified TypeScript interfaces and test data structures
   - Identify all page object patterns and test utility requirements
   - Understand test execution flow and validation requirements

2. **Codebase Pattern Analysis**
   - Examine referenced existing test files for patterns to follow
   - Understand current test project structure and conventions
   - Review existing page object implementations and naming patterns
   - Analyze test data management and mock strategies in use

3. **External Documentation Integration**
   - Access all specified URLs and extract relevant implementation guidance
   - Review Playwright/TypeScript documentation sections mentioned in PRP
   - Understand any third-party testing library integration requirements
   - Validate version compatibility for all dependencies

### Phase 2: Implementation Execution

Follow the exact task sequence specified in the PRP's "Implementation Tasks" section:

#### Task Execution Pattern

For each task in the PRP:

```typescript
// TASK EXECUTION TEMPLATE
// Task: [Exact task name from PRP]
// Dependencies: [Tasks that must complete first]
// File Location: [Exact path specified in PRP]
// Pattern Reference: [Existing file to follow from PRP context]

// 1. Create file structure as specified
// 2. Implement following exact patterns from PRP references
// 3. Apply TypeScript typing as defined in PRP
// 4. Validate against specified criteria before proceeding
// 5. Run immediate validation commands from PRP
```

#### Implementation Standards

- **TypeScript Type Safety**: All test data, page objects, and utilities must be fully typed
- **Pattern Consistency**: Follow exact patterns specified in PRP context references
- **Naming Conventions**: Use exact naming patterns defined in PRP (PascalCase, camelCase, etc.)
- **File Placement**: Create files in exact locations specified in desired codebase structure
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for test scenarios and page interactions

### Phase 3: Validation Gate Execution

Execute all validation levels exactly as specified in the PRP:

#### Level 1: Syntax & Test Setup Validation

```bash
# Execute exact commands from PRP Level 1 validation
npx playwright install                     # Browser installation
npx playwright check                       # Test syntax validation
npm run lint                              # Code quality checks
npx tsc --noEmit                          # TypeScript compilation
npx playwright test --list               # Test discovery validation
npx playwright test --dry-run            # Test structure validation
```

#### Level 2: Individual Test Validation

```bash
# Execute exact commands from PRP Level 2 validation
npx playwright test [specific-test-file] # Individual test execution
npx playwright test --headed             # Visual debugging validation
npx playwright test --project=chromium   # Browser-specific validation
npx playwright test --project=firefox    # Cross-browser validation
npx playwright test --project=webkit     # Safari compatibility validation
```

#### Level 3: Integration Testing Validation

```bash
# Execute exact commands from PRP Level 3 validation
npx playwright test                       # Full test suite execution
npx playwright test --parallel           # Parallel execution validation
npx playwright test --repeat-each=3      # Stability testing
npx playwright test --retries=2          # Retry behavior validation
npx playwright show-report              # Report generation validation
```

#### Level 4: CI/CD & Production Validation

```bash
# Execute exact commands from PRP Level 4 validation
# CI/CD simulation and production readiness checks
# Performance benchmarking and accessibility validation
# Environment-specific test execution validation
```

### Phase 4: Success Criteria Validation

Validate against every success criteria specified in the PRP:

## Quality Assurance Process

### Continuous Validation During Implementation

After each task completion:

1. **Immediate Syntax Check**
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit                       # TypeScript validation
   npm run lint                           # Code quality validation
   ```

2. **Incremental Test Validation**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test [new-test-file]    # New test execution
   npx playwright test --list            # Test discovery update
   ```

3. **Pattern Compliance Check**
   - Verify new code follows exact patterns from PRP context references
   - Confirm TypeScript interfaces match PRP specifications
   - Validate file placement matches desired codebase structure

### Error Resolution Protocol

When validation fails:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Compare implementation against exact PRP specifications
   - Check if all context references were properly followed
   - Verify TypeScript compilation and test syntax

2. **Pattern Debugging**
   - Re-examine referenced existing files for missed patterns
   - Validate against PRP context documentation
   - Check for Playwright-specific gotchas mentioned in PRP

3. **Systematic Fix Implementation**
   - Address issues following PRP anti-patterns guidance
   - Re-run validation commands until all pass
   - Document any deviations with clear justification

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Confidence Score Validation

Rate implementation success likelihood against PRP's specified confidence score target (minimum 8/10).

### Quality Standard Verification

Confirm all quality standards from PRP are met:
- Test reliability across target browsers
- Page object abstraction quality
- Test data isolation effectiveness
- Visual regression consistency (if applicable)
- API testing integration quality
- CI/CD pipeline efficiency

### Deliverable Completeness Check

Validate that all PRP deliverables are fully implemented:

   - All success criteria satisfied

2. **Test Quality Metrics**
   - Test execution reliability across browsers
   - Test coverage of specified scenarios
   - Performance characteristics within acceptable limits

3. **Production Readiness Assessment**
   - CI/CD integration capabilities
   - Environment configuration completeness
   - Maintenance and scaling considerations

4. **Documentation and Handoff**

   - Known limitations or constraints identified
   - Recommendations for ongoing maintenance

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid During Execution

- ❌ Don't deviate from PRP specifications without clear justification
- ❌ Don't skip validation gates or assume they'll pass
- ❌ Don't implement generic patterns when PRP specifies exact approaches
- ❌ Don't ignore TypeScript compilation errors or warnings
- ❌ Don't accept flaky tests - investigate and resolve reliability issues
- ❌ Don't proceed to next task if current task validation fails
- ❌ Don't modify test scope without updating success criteria
- ❌ Don't ignore cross-browser compatibility requirements from PRP
